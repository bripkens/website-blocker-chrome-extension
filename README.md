# Website Blocker for Chrome

This Chrome extension reduces distractions by breaking certain websites so that you cannot
use them. It is deliberately painful without a nice fallback to stop the FOMO cycle.

You can see the list of blocked websites within `manifest.json` (when you update the list, you
have to reload the extension within Chrome).
